#This project utilized computer vision and deep learning techniques to develop an AI-driven system for detecting and analyzing bone fractures from medical images. By applying state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system achieved accurate detection and localization of fractures in X-ray and CT scan images.

#The project seamlessly integrated computer vision to perform:

Image Analysis: Advanced preprocessing and augmentation techniques ensured the model handled variations in medical imaging, such as noise, lighting, and angle discrepancies.
Fracture Detection: Deep learning-based computer vision models, including YOLO, accurately identified fractures.
Fracture Localization: The system highlighted the precise fracture regions on the medical images using bounding boxes and heatmaps.
Automated Reporting: Combining computer vision insights with natural language generation, the system produced detailed diagnostic reports, including recommended treatment plans.
Technologies and Tools Used:

Computer Vision Libraries: OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras
Deep Learning Architectures: Custom CNNs and YOLO for object detection
Preprocessing Techniques: Image augmentation, resizing, and normalization
Data Sources: Public medical imaging datasets, such as MURA or similar resources
